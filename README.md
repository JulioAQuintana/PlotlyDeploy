Code Version 1.0

## Project Overview
Project require a completed panel for demographic information and visualization of the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the concept is to develop a dashboard to volunteers that will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Functions used in the project 

* ### 1. The map() Method
  #### _the map() method in JavaScript applies a transformation to each element in an array. Like a for loop, it can perform an operation to every element of an array. _

* ### The filter() Method.
    #### _The map() method in JavaScript applies a transformation to each element in an array. Like a for loop, it can perform an operation to every element of an array_

* ### 3. The slice() Method
    #### _the slice() method returns the first two elements of the integer array: [0,1]. The first argument is the position of where to begin the selection. _

the combination of previous functions provides the data to shape the chart to allow to the volunteers to get in easy way the information from the species found.

  ## Summary 
In the dashboard we worked in different functions for chart design, data model from JSON and web page design using images in the jumbotron, font color and styles by CSS file, include also a great final dashboard that with data analysis for Roza's project. see below image for dashboard
